Too many Newlines in editfield crashes stuff:
	Press Return (in editfield) sometimes and it just stops

MousePosition wrong if hovered over rightclickmenu:
	rightclick node > edit | add Connection; leftclick -> weird

Connection position not updated if size changes (eg. editing)

Can not close connection
